# efficientspatial

An epidemic modelling framework for all resolutions of gridded and polygon spatial data.

The "data/" directory should be placed in your working directory.

Three files are missing from the "data/" directory and must be downloaded externally:

- The ASCII file containing the population density data at the 100m resolution for England is available here (this should go in the "data/" subdirectory): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z0y5e9cYErGRdDUObJLC6sZL0EBnbYMD/view?usp=sharing
- The .shp file for Counties is available here (this should go in the "data/Counties/" subdirectory): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1So1dG1DVDIffWUdbzKgEf_C5vV2uaVXK/view?usp=sharing
- The .shp file for Districts is available here (this should go in the "data/Districts/" subdirectory): 

A step-by-step guide to help you learn how to use the spatial structure and resolution of your choice is included in the vignette. (coming soon)
