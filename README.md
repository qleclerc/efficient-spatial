# efficientspatial

An epidemic modelling framework for all resolutions of gridded and polygon spatial data.

The "data/" directory should be placed in your working directory.

Three files are missing from the "data/" directory and must be downloaded externally:

- The ASCII file containing the population density data at the 100m resolution for England is available here:
- The .shp file for Counties is available here (this should go in the "data/Counties/" subdirectory):
- The .shp file for Districts is available here (this should go in the "data/Districts/" subdirectory):

A step-by-step guide to help you learn how to use the spatial structure and resolution of your choice is included in the vignette.
